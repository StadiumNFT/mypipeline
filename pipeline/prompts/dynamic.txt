Given a FRONT and BACK image for the same card:
1) Identify category (sports/marvel/tcg/vintage/misc) and subcategory (brand, set).
2) Extract: year, set name, brand, card number, player OR character, team (if sports), parallel/insert if applicable.
3) Reason about condition: list visible flaws; do NOT assign a numeric grade.
4) Produce an SEO title: short, human, includes year, brand/set, player/character, card #, and any insert/parallel.
5) Price estimate: give a LOW and HIGH range in USD, appropriate for raw card condition. Base ranges on comparable commons vs stars if uncertain.
6) Return a concise category summary as the first line (e.g., "Category: Marvel > Masterpieces 2020").
Return valid JSON adhering to schemas/card.json and include a confidence score 0.0â€“1.0.
